## Development

Before starting to develop, make sure you have installed the following tools on your computer:
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) with a valid kube context configured
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), which is used to deploy vcluster and the plugin
- [vcluster CLI](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/getting-started/setup) v0.6.0 or higher
- [DevSpace](https://devspace.sh/cli/docs/quickstart), which is used to spin up a development environment

If you want to develop within a remote Kubernetes cluster (as opposed to docker-desktop or minikube), make sure to exchange `PLUGIN_IMAGE` in the `devspace.yaml` with a valid registry path you can push to.

After successfully setting up the tools, start the development environment with:
```
devspace dev -n vcluster
```

After a while a terminal should show up with additional instructions. Enter the following command to start the plugin:
```
go run -mod vendor main.go
```

The output should look something like this:
```
I0124 11:20:14.702799    4185 logr.go:249] plugin: Try creating context...
I0124 11:20:14.730044    4185 logr.go:249] plugin: Waiting for vcluster to become leader...
I0124 11:20:14.731097    4185 logr.go:249] plugin: Starting syncers...
[...]
I0124 11:20:15.957331    4185 logr.go:249] plugin: Successfully started plugin.
```

You can now change a file locally in your IDE and then restart the command in the terminal to apply the changes to the plugin.

Delete the development environment with:
```
devspace purge -n vcluster
```

## Using the Plugin in vcluster

### Building the Plugin
To just build the plugin image and push it to the registry, run:
```
# Build
docker build . -t my-repo/my-plugin:0.0.1

# Push
docker push my-repo/my-plugin:0.0.1
```

### Using the plugin

To use the plugin, create a new vcluster with the `plugin.yaml`:

```
# Use local plugin.yaml
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster -f ./plugin.yaml

# Use public plugin.yaml
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefresh-contrib/vcluster-prometheus-operator-plugin/main/v1/plugin.yaml
```

This will create a new vcluster with the plugin installed.
